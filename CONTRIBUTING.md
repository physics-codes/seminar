### Thanks for Your Help!

Contributing is so kind of you. Collaborative curriculum is the name of the 
game here. All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation 
improvements, enhancements and ideas are welcome.

The [GitHub "issues" tab](https://github.com/physics-codes/seminar/issues)
contains some issues labeled "first PR". Those are open issues that would be a
good quick way to get started. Browse them to see if you want to get started on
one.

#### Bug Reports

  - Please include a short but detailed, self-contained Python snippet or
    explanation for reproducing the problem.

  - Explain what the expected behavior was, and what you saw instead.

##### Pull Requests

  - **Make sure the test suite passes** on your computer. To do so, run `nosetests` in the tests directory.
  - Please reference relevant Github issues in your commit message using `GH1234`
    or `#1234`. 
  - Changes should be PEP8 compatible [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
  - Keep style fixes to a separate commit to make your PR more readable.
  - Docstrings ideally follow the [numpydoc](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt) format.
  - Write tests.
  - When writing tests, please.
  - When you start working on a PR, start by creating a new branch pointing at the latest
    commit on github master.
  - Please avoid rebasing if possible. Nothing wrong with rebase... it is just confusing for @katyhuff .
  - The copyright policy is CC-BY-4.0 and is detailed in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/physics-codes/seminar/blob/master/LICENSE) file.
