Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
fullest extent possible.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

Licence

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC 
LICENCE (hereafter "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE 
LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENCE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY 
THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN 
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions.
	a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a dictionary, yearbook, encyclopedia, or a 
	newspaper, review magazine or singular periodical and any work written in distinct 
	parts by different authors, or in which works or parts of works of different authors 
	are incorporated. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a 
	Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this licence.

	b. "Derivative Work" means a work that produces or reproduces the Work or any 
	substantial part thereof in any material form. Derivative works include:
		i. Translations of the Work;
		
		ii. Where the Work is a dramatic work, conversions of the Work into a novel or 
		other non-dramatic work;
		
		iii. Where the Work is a novel or other non-dramatic work or an artistic work, 
		conversions of the Work into a dramatic work by way of performance in public or 
		otherwise;
		
		iv. Where the Work is a literary or dramatic or musical work, making a sound 
		recording, cinematograph film or other mechanical contrivance by means of which 
		the Work may be mechanically reproduced or performed; and
		
		v. Where the Work is a literary or dramatic or musical or artistic work, 
		reproductions, adaptations or public presentations of the Work as a 
		cinematographic work.
		
	A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for 
	the purpose of this Licence. Where the Work is a musical composition or sound 
	recording, the synchronization of the Work in time-relation with a moving image (i.e. 
	cinematographic work "synching") will be treated as a Derivative Work for the purpose 
	of this Licence.

	c. "Licence Elements" means the following high-level Licence attributes as selected by 
	Licensor and indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution, Noncommercial, 
	NoDerivatives, ShareAlike.

	d. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of 
	this Licence.
	
	e. "Moral Rights" means rights that an individual who creates a Work protected by 
	copyright has concerning the integrity of the work, the attribution (or anonymity) of 
	authorship, and the right not to be associated with a product, service, cause or 
	institution, or rights of similar nature in the Work anywhere in the world.
	
	f. "Musical Work" means any work of music or musical composition, with or without 
	words, and includes any compilation thereof.
	
	g. "Original Author" means the individual who created the Work.
	
	h. "Use" means to exercise one or more of the rights set out below as granted by the 
	Licence and includes the title thereof when such title is original and distinctive.
		
		i. to produce or reproduce the work in any material form;
		
		ii. to perform the work in public;
		
		iii. if the work is unpublished, to publish the work;
		
		iv. to convert a dramatic work into a non-dramatic work;

		v. to convert a non-dramatic work into a dramatic work;

		vi. to make a sound recording, cinematographic film or other contrivance by means 
		of which the work may be mechanically reproduced or performed;
		
		vii. to reproduce, adapt and publicly present the work, as a cinematographic film;

		viii. to communicate the work to the public by telecommunication;

		ix. to present at a public exhibition, for a purpose other than sale or hire, an 
		artistic work created after June 7, 1988, other than a map, chart or plan;

		x. to rent a computer program;

		xi. to rent a sound recording embodying a musical work; and/or

		xii. to authorize such acts.

	i. "Work" means the distinctive and original work of authorship offered under the 
	terms of this Licence.

	j. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Licence who has 
	not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the Work, or who has 
	received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence 
	despite a previous violation.
	
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict 
any rights accruing to fair dealing, and those exemptions afforded to individuals, 
educational institutions, libraries, archives, museums, computer programs, incidental 
inclusions and ephemeral recordings, or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the 
copyright owner under the Copyright Act.

3. Licence Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, Licensor hereby 
grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the 
applicable copyright) Licence to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

	a. to Use the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to 
	Use the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works.
	
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter 
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically 
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.

All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not 
limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(b) and 4(d).

Except as otherwise agreed by the Original Author, if You Use a Work or any Derivative 
Works or Collective Works in any material form, You must not do anything that would offend 
the Moral Rights of the Original Author, including but not limited to:

	i. You must not falsely attribute the Work to someone other than the Original Author; 
	and
	ii. If applicable, You must respect the Original Author's wish to remain anonymous or 
	pseudonymous.
	
All other moral rights are waived. This means the Original Author is not reserving the 
ability to prevent downstream creators from engaging in material distortion or 
modification of the work, including, but limited to, associating the Work with a 
particular product, service, cause or institution.

4. Restrictions. The licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and 
limited by the following restrictions:

	a. You may Use the Work only under the terms of this Licence, and You must include a 
	copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this Licence with every copy or 
	soundrecordings of the Work You Use. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work 
	that alter or restrict the terms of this or the recipients' exercise of the rights 
	granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices 
	that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not Use the 
	Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a 
	manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence Agreement.

	The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not 
	require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms 
	of this Licence.

	If You create a Collective Work, upon request from any Licensor You must, to the 
	extent practicable, include or remove from the Collective Work any credit required by 
	clause 4(c).

	b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any 
	manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or 
	private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by 
	means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for 
	or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided 
	there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of 
	copyrighted works.

	c. If you Use the Work or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices 
	for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You 
	are utilizing to the (i) Original Author by using his, her or its name (or pseudonym) 
	if supplied; and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another 
	party or parties (eg. a sponsor institution, publishing entity, journal) for 
	attribution in Licensor's copyright notice or terms of service or by other reasonable 
	means, then to such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent 
	reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor 
	specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the 
	copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. Such credit may be implemented 
	in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at 
	a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears 
	and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

	d. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition, performer's 
	performance or sound recording:

		i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licences. Licensor reserves the exclusive 
		right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society, 
		royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) 
		of the musical Work, sound recording or performer's performance if that 
		performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or 
		private monetary compensation.

		ii. Mechanical Rights in Musical Works. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to 
		collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency, collective society, or 
		designated agent, royalties for any soundrecording You create from the musical 
		Work ("cover version") if Your Use of such cover version is primarily intended for 
		or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer. UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE 
PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR 
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, 
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO 
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT 
FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE 
WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY 
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF 
THIS LICENCE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination.
	a. This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any 
	breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities who have received 
	Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have their licences 
	terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those 
	licences. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this Licence.
	
	b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the licence granted here is perpetual 
	(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, 
	Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to 
	stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will 
	not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been, or is required 
	to be, granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in 
	full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous.
	
	a. Each time You Use the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the 
	recipient a licence to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the licence 
	granted to You under this Licence.

	b. If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, 
	it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of 
	this Licence, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such 
	provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision 
	valid and enforceable.

	c. No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented 
	to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be 
	charged with such waiver or consent.

	d. This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to 
	the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations 
	with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any 
	additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This Licence may 
	not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

	e. You must abide the Licence during its term despite the expiry, initial invalidity 
	or later invalidation of any intellectual property rights.

	f. The construction, validity and performance of this Licence shall be governed by the 
	laws in force in Canada and, where applicable, those of the province in which the 
	Licensor normally resides.
